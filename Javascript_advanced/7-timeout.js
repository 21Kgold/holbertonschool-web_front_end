/*
Start of the execution queue

...
100
End of the loop printing
Final code block to be executed
*/

/*
Now, let's analyze the execution order:

The line console.log("Start of the execution queue"); is executed first, printing
"Start of the execution queue" to the console.

The setTimeout function is called and schedules the code block 
console.log("Final code block to be executed"); to be executed after a delay of
0 milliseconds. However, it is not executed immediately because it is added to
the event queue and waits for the current execution context to finish.

The for loop is executed synchronously, printing the numbers 1 to 100 to the console

After the for loop completes, console.log("End of the loop printing"); is executed,
printing "End of the loop printing" to the console.

At this point, the current execution context is finished, and the event loop checks
if there are any tasks in the event queue to be executed. It finds the delayed code
block console.log("Final code block to be executed"); and executes it. The message
"Final code block to be executed" is printed to the console.
