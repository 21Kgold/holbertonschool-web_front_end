# Javascript advanced

## Description

JavaScript is a very function-oriented language. A function can be created at any moment, passed as an argument to another function, and then called from a totally different place of code later. To understand how JavaScript functions behave in different scenarios, the following concepts and technologies are explored in this project:
* What is lexical scope in JavaScript?
* What is closure in JavaScript?
* How to use the closure
* How to chain different closures
* How to mock private methods with closure
* The order of stack execution with JavaScript
* How to use binding
* How to use callbacks
